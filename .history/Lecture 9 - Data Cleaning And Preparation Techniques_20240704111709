In this lecture, we will delve into various data cleaning and preparation techniques that are essential for ensuring the quality and accuracy of your data. Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process, as it helps to remove inconsistencies, errors, and redundancies from your dataset. By employing these techniques, you can transform raw data into a more structured and usable format, which is vital for accurate analysis and decision-making.

One of the fundamental functions used in data cleaning is the TRIM function. This function is particularly useful for removing any leading or trailing spaces from text strings, which can often cause issues in data processing. Another important function is SPLIT, which allows you to divide a text string into multiple parts based on a specified delimiter. This can be incredibly helpful when dealing with data that is stored in a single column but needs to be separated into multiple columns for better analysis.
