In this lecture, we will delve into various data 
cleaning and preparation techniques that are essential 
for ensuring the quality and accuracy of your data. Data
 cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process,
  as it helps to remove inconsistencies, errors, and 
  redundancies from your dataset. By employing these 
  techniques, you can transform raw data into a more 
  structured and usable format, which is vital for accurate
   analysis and decision-making.

One of the fundamental functions used in data cleaning 
is the TRIM function. This function is particularly useful 
for removing any leading or trailing spaces from text strings, 
-which can often cause issues in data processing. 
Another important function is SPLIT, which allows you
 to divide a text string into multiple parts based on
  a specified delimiter. This can be incredibly helpful
   when dealing with data that is stored in a single column 
   but needs to be separated into multiple columns for better analysis.

The PROPER function is another valuable tool in data cleaning. 
It capitalizes the first letter of each word in a text string, 
making the data more readable and standardized. 
The IF function is a versatile tool that enables you to perform 
logical tests and return different values based on the outcome 
of those tests. This can be used to create conditional statements 
that help in data validation and error checking.

The UPPER and LOWER functions are used to convert text strings to uppercase and lowercase, respectively. These functions are useful for standardizing text data, ensuring consistency across your dataset. The IFERROR function is designed to handle errors in your data by returning a specified value if an error is detected. This can help to prevent errors from disrupting your data analysis process.

The LEFT, MID, and RIGHT functions are used to extract specific portions of a text string. The LEFT function extracts a specified number of characters from the beginning of a text string, while the RIGHT function extracts characters from the end. The MID function allows you to extract a substring from the middle of a text string, based on a specified starting point and length.

The CONCATENATE function is used to combine multiple text strings into a single string. This can be useful for merging data from different columns or creating new data fields. The TEXTJOIN function is similar to CONCATENATE but offers more flexibility by allowing you to specify a delimiter to be used between each text string.

In summary, these functions are essential tools for data cleaning and preparation. By mastering these techniques, you can ensure that your data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. Proper data cleaning not only improves the quality of your data but also enhances the reliability of your analysis and the decisions based on that analysis.
