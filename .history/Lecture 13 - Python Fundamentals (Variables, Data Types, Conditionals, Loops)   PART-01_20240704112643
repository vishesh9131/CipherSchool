Conditionals:
Definition: Conditional statements in Python (if, elif, else) allow you to execute code based on specific conditions.
Use Case: In an e-commerce app, conditionals can determine pricing tiers based on user membership levels (e.g., standard, premium, VIP).

# Basic if-elif-else statement
age = 20
if age < 18:
    print("Minor")
elif 18 <= age < 65:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Senior")

# Check if a number is even or odd
number = 42
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Even Number")
else:
    print("Odd Number")

# Grade Evaluation
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")

# Temperature Check
temperature = 30
if temperature > 30:
    print("It's a hot day")
elif temperature >= 20:
    print("It's a nice day")
else:
    print("It's a cold day")

# Nested Condition for BMI Calculation
weight = 70  # in kg
height = 1.75  # in meters
bmi = weight / (height ** 2)
if bmi < 18.5:
    print("Underweight")
elif bmi < 24.9:
    print("Normal weight")
elif bmi < 29.9:
    print("Overweight")
else:
    print("Obesity")

# Traffic Light System
traffic_light = "Green"
if traffic_light == "Red":
    print("Stop")
elif traffic_light == "Yellow":
    print("Caution")
elif traffic_light == "Green":
    print("Go")
else:
    print("Invalid traffic light color")

# User login status
is_logged_in = True
has_permission = True
if is_logged_in:
    if has_permission:
        print("Access granted")
    else:
        print("Access Denied")
else:
    print("Access Denied")

# Multiple Conditions (AND/OR)
temperature = 25
weather = "Sunny"
if temperature > 20 and weather == "Sunny":
    print("It's a great day for a walk")
elif temperature <= 20 or weather != "Sunny":
    print("Maybe stay indoors today")
else:
    print("Weather conditions are unusual")

Loops:
Definition: Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Python supports for and while loops.
Use Case: Loops can process items in a list. For example, a for loop can iterate through a list of employees to calculate their salaries.

# For Loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Iterating over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Iterating over a String
greeting = "Hello"
for char in greeting:
    print(char)

# Iterating over a Dictionary
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

# Using the 'range()' function with a Step
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)

# Nested for loop
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"i = {i}, j = {j}")

# Using the 'enumerate()' Function
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# While loop using Break
count = 0
while True:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    if count >= 5:
        break

# While loop using Continue
count = 0
while count < 10:
    count += 1
    if count % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(count)

# While loop for validation
password = ""
while len(password) < 8:
    password = input("Enter a password that should be more than 8 digits: ")
    if len(password) < 8:
        print("Password is too short.")
    else:
        print("Password accepted.")
