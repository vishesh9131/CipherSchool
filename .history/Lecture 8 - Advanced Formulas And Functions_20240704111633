How to Write a Formula in Excel?

To begin writing a formula in Excel, you first need to select the cell where you want the result to appear. Once the cell is selected, you should enter an equals sign (=) to indicate to Excel that you are about to input a formula. For instance, if you are working with the four times table, you would start by typing the formula in cell E3. Specifically, you would enter =A3*C3 into cell E3. After typing the formula, press the enter key to execute it. 
1. Select the cell.
2. Enter and equals sign so Excel knows a formula is being entered.
3. Using the example of the four times table.
  • In cell E3 type: =A3*C3.
  • Press enter.
4. Select E3 and drag bottom right corner down to E12.
5. The formula has been applied to all these cells.
