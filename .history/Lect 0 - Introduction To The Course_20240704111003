COURSE STRUCTURE

1. Introduction to Data Science
This section provides a comprehensive overview of data science, emphasizing its significance in today's data-driven world. It introduces the data science workflow, outlining the key steps involved in a typical data science project. Additionally, it highlights the essential skills and tools that are crucial for anyone aspiring to become a data scientist.

2. Setting Up Your Environment
In this module, you will learn how to set up your data science environment. It begins with an introduction to Anaconda, a popular distribution for Python and R programming, and guides you through its installation and management of Python environments. The module also covers Google Colab, a cloud-based platform that allows you to write and execute Python code in a web-based notebook. Furthermore, it introduces version control with Git and GitLab, explaining the basics of version control, how to use Git for project management, and how to collaborate using GitLab.

3. Advanced Excel for Data Analysis
This section delves into advanced Excel techniques for data analysis. It covers complex formulas and functions that can help you manipulate and analyze data more effectively. You will also learn about data cleaning and preparation techniques, which are essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of your data. The module includes lessons on Pivot Tables, PivotCharts, and Power Query, which are powerful tools for summarizing and visualizing data. Additionally, it introduces Excel macros and VBA for automation, enabling you to automate repetitive tasks and streamline your workflow.

4. Python for Data Science
In this module, you will gain a solid foundation in Python programming, which is a critical skill for data scientists. It covers the fundamentals of Python, including variables, data types, conditionals, and loops. You will also learn about functions, lambda expressions, and error handling. The module includes lessons on working with data using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library, and NumPy, a library for numerical computing. These tools will enable you to perform data manipulation and analysis efficiently.

5. Data Visualization
This section focuses on the principles of data visualization, which is the art of presenting data in a visual format that is easy to understand and interpret. It introduces Matplotlib and Seaborn, two popular Python libraries for creating static and interactive visualizations. You will also learn how to create interactive visualizations using Plotly, a library that allows you to build interactive plots and dashboards.
